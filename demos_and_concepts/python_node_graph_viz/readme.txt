```
is there a graphical tool, where python classes can inherit a base class called "graph_me_node", and from a starting node or list of nodes, it analyzes the node's dictionary items for links to other objects with base class "graph_me_node", and generates a graphic with links colour-coded based on the name of the class private variable's name?
```

ohhh fun idea — “plug in my objects and get a rainbow spaghetti map” 🌈🍝
short answer: there isn’t an off-the-shelf tool that *exactly* does “walk my Python object graph, follow only subclasses of X, and color links by attribute name.” Closest pieces: **graphviz/pygraphviz** (rendering), **networkx** (graph data), and **objgraph** (memory ref graphs). But your rules (base class + attr-name-colored edges) are custom, so the clean path is a tiny utility. ⚙️

### 🧰 What exists (and why it’s not quite it) 🔍

* **objgraph**: great for debugging reference cycles; follows GC refs, not your semantic model; no edge colors by attribute name.
* **graphviz / pygraphviz**: perfect renderer; you feed it nodes/edges with styles.
* **networkx**: handy for building the graph, then export to DOT for Graphviz.

So… let’s roll a lightweight “**graph\_me**” helper. 🚀

---

### 🧩 Design (simple + safe) 🧠

* You define `class GraphMeNode:` and make your classes subclass it.
* We start from one or many root objects.
* We walk `__dict__` (and optional containers) to find attributes that are `GraphMeNode` instances (or collections thereof).
* We **color edges by attribute name** (stable color per name), label edges with the attribute, and label nodes with `ClassName#short_id` (and optional `.name`/`.id` if present).
* We handle cycles (visited set), container types (`list/tuple/set/dict`).
* Output: **Graphviz DOT + SVG/PNG**.

**How to use:**

```python
class Author(GraphMeNode):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self._books = []         # private attribute => will be colored uniquely

class Book(GraphMeNode):
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title
        self.chapters = []

class Chapter(GraphMeNode):
    def __init__(self, title, notes=None):
        self.title = title
        self.notes = notes or []

a = Author("Ada")
b1 = Book("Apples: A Thesis")
b2 = Book("Bananas: A Rebuttal")
a._books.extend([b1, b2])

c1 = Chapter("Claim: Apples are popular")
c2 = Chapter("Evidence: survey results")
b1.chapters.extend([c1, c2])

outfile, _ = graph_me(a, filename="idea_graph", format="svg", include_private=True)
print("wrote", outfile)
```

You’ll get an **SVG**: nodes are your objects, edges are colored by the **attribute name** (e.g., `_books` is one color, `chapters` another). If an attribute is a list/dict, the label shows the index/key (e.g., `chapters[1]`). 🎨

### 🧯 Notes & nice-to-haves 🧩

* **Edge palette overflow:** the color map cycles if you have more unique attribute names than colors. Expand `_palette()` as needed or hash to HSL strings.
* **Filtering:** pass `include_private=False` to ignore attributes starting with `_`.
* **Slots:** set `follow_slots=False` if your classes use `__slots__` and you don’t want to traverse them.
* **Cycles:** handled via `seen`.
* **Big graphs:** use `max_nodes` to bail out gracefully.

---

### 🛸 Extras you can bolt on (later) ⚡

* **Legend:** generate a small legend mapping attribute → color as a subgraph.
* **Edge styles by type:** solid for `GraphMeNode`, dashed for “soft refs” (e.g., if you decide to traverse strings that look like IDs).
* **Interactive web view:** export the edges as JSON and visualize with D3/vis-network for pan/zoom and attribute toggles.
* **Type guards:** only traverse attributes annotated with `GraphMeNode` in type hints if you want strictness.

if you want, I can add a **legend** and a **D3-powered interactive HTML** export so you can click attributes on/off like lighting rigs at a concert. 🎚️🕺
